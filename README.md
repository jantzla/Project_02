# Dietary Recommendations for Depression: Insights from NHANES 2007-2020

# Overview
This project investigates the link between dietary habits and mental health using data from the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2007 and 2020. It examines differences in daily nutrient intake between adults with and without depression, exploring dietary implications for depression management. The analysis provides insights into potential nutritional strategies for improving mental well-being.

# Data Source
The analysis is based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 2007 to 2020. This data encompasses various dimensions curcial for the data analysis.

DEMOGRAPHICS DATA:
Gender and Age: Fundamental demographic variables to examine the impact of dietary habits on depression across different age groups and genders.

QUESTIONAIRE DATA:
This component of the data utilises data derived from actual questionnaires completed by NHANES participants, providing direct insights into their dietary habits and mental health status.

1. Nutrition Intake Per Day: Participants were asked to recall and report their food and beverage intake over the last 24 hours. This detailed account includes the quantity and type of food consumed, allowing for an accurate calculation of the nutrient composition. The dataset subsequently displays the total intake of various nutrients, including both macro-nutrients (such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats) and micro-nutrients (such as vitamins and minerals).

2. Mental Health (Depression Screener): The dataset employs the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) as a measure of depression levels among participants. This well-established tool comprises nine questions that gauge the frequency and severity of depression symptoms, allowing for a nuanced understanding of the participants' mental health.
